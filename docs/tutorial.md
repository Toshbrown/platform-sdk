#Databox SDK

The databox SDK is a visual programming environment for building databox apps. The goal of the Databox SDK is to enable the rapid development of Databox applications.   **Databox apps can be built without using the sdk, but the sdk streamlines the process and makes it possible to build a subset of apps without resorting to code**
